catlang
=======

Python implementation of the cat language ( http://www.cat-language.com ).

I am not actively working on this, however there seems to be enough interest 
in making it available for people.

Changes or bug fixes are most welcome, submitting them as pull requests here
on github would be a good idea.

Otherwise do with this as you will.
